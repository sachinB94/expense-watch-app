# Expense Watch

Expense Watch is an app to visualize your money go. It allows you to add the expenses as you spend them, and then view them in some cool graphs, so that you can manage money better.


### Features

* Gulp jobs for development, building, emulating and running your app
* Local development server with live reload, even inside ios emulator
* Automatically inject all your JS sources into `index.html`
* Auto min-safe all Angular DI through `ng-annotate`, no need to use weird bracket notation


### Installation

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sachinb94/expense-watch-app.git
```

Install npm and bower dependencies

```bash
npm install && bower install
```

after installation, just run:
```bash
gulp
```
to start up the build job and file watchers.

### Set API

Set the Server Uri in `app/scripts/config/Constants.js`.
Currently the server is hosted at `https://expense-watch.herokuapp.com`.
Server code can be cloned from `https://github.com/sachinb94/expense-watch`

## Workflow

This doc assumes you have `gulp` globally installed (`npm install -g gulp`).
If you do not have / want gulp globally installed, you can run `npm run gulp` instead.

#### Development mode

By running just `gulp`, we start our development build process, consisting of:

- compiling, concatenating, auto-prefixing of all `.scss` files required by `app/styles/main.scss`
- creating `vendor.js` file from external sources defined in `./vendor.json`
- creating `vendor.css` file from external sources defined in `./vendor-css.json`
- linting all `*.js` files `app/scripts`, see `.jshintrc` for ruleset
- automatically inject sources into `index.html` so we don't have to add / remove sources manually
- build everything into `.tmp` folder (also gitignored)
- start local development server and serve from `.tmp`
- start watchers to automatically lint javascript source files, compile scss and reload browser on changes


#### Build mode

By running just `gulp --build` or short `gulp -b`, we start gulp in build mode

- concat all `.js` sources into single `app.js` file
- version `main.css` and `app.js`
- build everything into `www`
- remove debugs messages such as `console.log` or `alert` with passing `--release`


#### Emulate

By running `gulp -e <platform>`, we can run our app in the simulator

- <platform> can be either `ios` or `android`, defaults to `ios`
- make sure to have iOS Simulator installed in XCode, as well as `ios-sim` package globally installed (`npm install -g ios-sim`)
- for Android, [Ripple](http://ripple.incubator.apache.org/) or [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) seem to be the emulators of choice
- It will run the `gulp --build` before, so we have a fresh version to test
- In iOS, it will livereload any code changes in iOS simulator

#### Emulate a specific iOS device

By running `gulp select` you will see a prompt where you can choose which ios device to emulate. This works only when you have the `gulp -e` task running in one terminal window and run `gulp select` in another terminal window.


#### Ripple Emulator

Run `gulp ripple` to open your app in a browser using ripple. This is useful for emuating a bunch of different Android devices and settings, such as geolocation, battery status, globalization and more. Note that ripple is still in beta and will show weird debug messages from time to time.


#### Run

By running `gulp -r <platform>`, we can run our app on a connected device

- <platform> can be either `ios` or `android`, defaults to `ios`
- It will run the `gulp --build` before, so we have a fresh version to test
